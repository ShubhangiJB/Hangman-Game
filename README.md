# Hangman-Game

Game Rules#

The object of hangman is to guess the secret word before the stick figure is hung. 

The player guesses a letter to narrow the word down. 

Correctly guessed letters are filled into relevant blanks in the word.

If the guessed letter is incorrect, then they get a strike that brings them closer to losing. 
To show this, a stick figure of a man being hung is drawn, adding a new part to the drawing with every wrong answer.

Gameplay continues until the player guesses the word or they run out of guesses and the stick figure is hung.
